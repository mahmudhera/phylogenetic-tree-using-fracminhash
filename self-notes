Robensen-Folds distance
Add more bacterial genomes
Start with a known Phylo tree based off of 16S
GTDB te start korbo??

copy, WABI format

check bootstrapping values. sample dist matrix a lot of times. each time see if tree branches change or not


PCOA -- compare the two dist matrices -- MDS -- multi dimensional scaling

take the organisms -- do MSA -- get pairwide evo dist
